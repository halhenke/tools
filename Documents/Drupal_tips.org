* Forms


* Nodes

You can use the whole node api/ecosystem
of node_info
node_form
node_insert
node_update
node_load
node_view

To manage what happens with your extra fields that arent part of the node => {:title =>"title", :body => "body"}
thing

OR.....

You can just have
node_info
node_form
and
node_submit
and in node_submit you call node_save to create a new node and then directly edit your other tables....

node_theme or themes in general are apparently pretty cool ways to get everything looking good.
